A scraper to pull in all data from Indeed and produce a table of relevant job listings, and apply a ranking to them.
There are three files that the scraper uses to find jobs, "SearchLocations," "SearchPositions,", and "JobExclusionTerms."
"JobExclusionTerms" will match the job title to any term, and if it matches, it will not record the job listing. Be careful
with this, and use spaces if necessary because you might accidentally match something you didn't mean to (i.e. "SR" will
match other words like "grassroots" or "disrupt"). The next two files, "CompanyRatings" and "JobDescriptionTerms" are what
the code uses to rank the jobs. Every time you run the code, it will generate a list of companies, and put them into 
"CompanyRatings." It is up to you to go through it and rank them, if you don't, it will default to listing them all as "1's."
It's a lot of work, so it might be simplest to just scroll through and number the companies that you already know you like.
The "JobDescriptionTerms" contains multipliers that are used to determine how good of a fit this job is for you. A good job
gets a greater than 1 number, a bad job gets some fraction. It's up to you to determine your own range of good to bad, the
ranking system just finds whether any term occurs in the job description, and multiplies the ranking by the associated
multiplier.

Have fun, happy job searching!
